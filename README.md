# Tests and Visualisation of MCMC Sampling Methods used in Bayesian-Inference
This repository stores the code used for experiments in testing detailed balance and correctness of MCMC sampling methods presented in the thesis.<br/>
PINTS library(https://pints.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is used in this implementation.
